# E-Bike LED System
This project is born to add some LEDS under my E-Bike, than I decided to release all this stuff... That's why you're reading this S*IT.

Anyway, in future I'll post here all the images for the electronic stuff, here is the list of components I've used:

* ESP 32 WROOM MODULE
* LEVEL SHIFTER
* WS2812B Addressable LED strip
* A bunch of jumper wires
* A breadboard

~~In september I will transfer this to my bike using a piece of proofboard and I will write a proper description and documentation.~~ 
Yes... it's october and I didn't tested this ~~sh*t~~.
Yep... it's May 2022... I don't have the bike ðŸ––

**THE APP WAS MADE WITH KODULAR SO DON'T ASK ME FOR THE SOURCE CODE** just take the .aia file and import it in a project.

**UPDATE 0.4.3**

Since I changed Kodular account you have to uninstall the app and reinstall it otherwise you'll find two application on your phone.
